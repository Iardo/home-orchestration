# Readline Init File
#
# Although the Readline library comes with a set of Emacs-like keybindings
# installed by default, it is possible to use a different set of keybindings.
# Any user can customize programs that use Readline by putting commands in an
# inputrc file, conventionally in his home directory.
#
# The name of this file is taken from the value of the shell variable INPUTRC.
#   If that variable is unset, the default is ~/.inputrc.
#   If that file does not exist or cannot be read, the ultimate default is /etc/inputrc.
#
# The bind builtin command can also be used to set Readline keybindings and variables.
# 
# When a program which uses the Readline library starts up, the init file is read,
# and the key bindings are set.
